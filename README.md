# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
#description
In this  exploratory data analysis is performed on the Titanic dataset to understand data distribution, feature relationships, and potential patterns. Missing values in the 'Age' and 'Embarked' columns were handled using median and mode imputation. Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, pairplots, and countplots were used to analyze distributions and correlations. An interactive scatter plot was created to explore relationships between age, fare, and survival. The analysis helped in identifying key features relevant for modeling.
